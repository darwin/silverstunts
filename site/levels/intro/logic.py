# here you should define level behavior
#
# init is called during level intialization, 
#      all entities are already created 
#      so you can tweak them
#
# tick is called for every game tick
#      t == tick number
#      e == elapsed time in milliseconds from level start
#
# you can also use <surface>.onContact to handle contact events
#
# more to come ... stay tuned and see cavanagh example
